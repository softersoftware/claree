# Glossary of business terms

The bridge between the business documentation ([`docs/domain/`](domain/README.md), tool-free) and the code. Every business term used in the domain documents maps here to its name in the code.

The platform's domain documents and its code are both in English, so this glossary is not a translation — it fixes **which** English word is used, and forbids the synonyms. Most naming drift in a codebase is not a wrong word; it is three right ones for the same thing.

When a new concept appears: define it first in [`docs/domain/`](domain/README.md), choose its name, and add it here **before** using it in the code.

> Every project has its own glossary, in its own language. This one is the platform's.

## Project and participants — [project.md](domain/project.md)

| Business term | Name in the code | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project | `Project` | one application, carried by its project owner |
| Name of a project | `Project.name` | the title of its README; its address when there is none |
| Scope | `Project.scope` | short, broad, deliberately vague |
| The platform | `productName` | what this repository builds; called by its name only on its screens, in the README's title and in its branding |
| Participant | `Participant` | anyone taking part |
| Domain expert | `domainExpert` | knows the business; their words are the business's; confirms and validates. Not *customer* or *client* |
| Project owner | `projectOwner` | keeps the repository; settles what the domain experts leave open |
| Maker | `maker` | listens, brings the craft, builds and maintains |
| Language of a project | `Project.language` | the domain experts'; never translated |
| Language the platform speaks | `Locale` | chosen by the person; a convenience |
| Speaking the project's language | `localeIn` | asked for by the person; translates nothing |
| Address of a project | `address` | where its project owner keeps it |
| Opening a project | `ProjectFiles.open` | reads what is kept at its address, or nothing when it cannot be read |
| What is kept at an address | `KeptFiles` | read as it was when the project was opened |
| Repository of a project | `KeptFiles` | its files and their history, kept at its address |
| README of a project | `readme` | where it says what it is: its name and its scope |
| Reading the name and scope | `nameAndScope` | from the README; never written by the platform |
| Link to a repository | `KeptFiles.link`, `repositoryLink` | where a person looks at it without the platform; none when a browser cannot open it |
| Public project | — | read without saying who you are; not in the code yet |
| Private project | — | read only by the people it recognises; not in the code yet |
| Recognised by the project | — | who may change it; not in the code yet |
| Projects someone added | — | kept for them alone; grants nothing; not in the code yet |
| Someone's projects | — | the ones they added and can open; not in the code yet |

## The business — [business.md](domain/business.md)

| Where a document is kept | `WorkshopDocument.location` | to go back to it |
| Text of a document | `WorkshopDocument.text` | when it is written in the project |
| Adding a document | `addDocument` | possible after the day |
| Correcting a document | `correctDocument` | replaces its text |
| Workshops by date | `workshopsByDate` | most recent first |
| Domain | `Domain` | one part of the business, with its own words |
| What a domain is | `Domain.description` | business only; never what the application does |
| Lexicon | `Term` | one concept, one name, one definition |
| Lexicon of a domain | `termsOf` | |
| Description of a domain | `rulesOf` | |
| Description | `Rule` | one sentence a domain expert can confirm or deny |
| Proposed (state) | `proposed` | written, not yet confirmed |
| Agreed (state) | `agreed` | confirmed by a domain expert |
| Agreeing | `agree` | |
| Rewriting a rule | `restate` | makes it `proposed` again |
| Question | `Question` | something the project knows it does not know |
| Domain of a question | `Question.domainId` | every question belongs to exactly one |
| Questions of a domain | `questionsOf` | |

## The solution — [solution.md](domain/solution.md)

| Business term | Name in the code | Note |

| Being tried / validated | `being_tried` / `validated` | |
| Validating a prototype | `validate` | by a domain expert |
| Mock-up / demonstration | — | a refined prototype, connected to nothing; not in the code yet |
| Feature | `Feature` | one thing the application offers |
| Stories of a feature | `storiesOf` | a feature with none describes nothing |
